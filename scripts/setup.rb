I'll try to install most of these things for you
but be aware your computer will likely have unique errors/challenges

to test you'll need: 
    nodejs â‰¥ v13.7.0 (exact version is better than a newer version)
    npm â‰¥ 6.13.6 (exact version is better than a newer version)
 
you'll need emscriptem for WASM
    get asdf, a version manager of many things
    this project uses multpile versions of python at different times
